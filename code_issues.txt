Issues that were found in the original version of the code:

- Bug the vocabulary file. This affected the generation of the random embeddings as well as the vocabulary used for Bert and Elmo embeddings. See details here: https://github.com/DS3Lab/cognival/tree/master/sideCode/random-baseline

- The random baseline is not robust since we only compare one run.

- Depending on the folder structure used for the results, this can affect the count of hypotheses in the significance testing.
