# Generate random embeddings for baseline

This directory contains the vocabulary files and script used to generate the random baseline.

Please note that there was a bug in the original code, so that the vocabulary was slighty different. The file "allwords_original_paper.txt" contains the original vocabulary used for the publication, while "allwords.txt" is the corrected version.
